Provides an alternative to using AsyncCallback for managing asynchronous communication and calls.

<P>Many Google Web Toolkit methods utilize an instance of the {@link AsyncCallback} interface to
handle asynchronous interactions.  This leads to complicated and difficult code when dealing
with chaining together multiple asynchronous actions.
</P>

<P>The Async Future package provides an alternative that uses functional programming techniques to
simplify the calling of asynchronous methods.
